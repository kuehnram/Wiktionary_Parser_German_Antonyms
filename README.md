## Applications and Usage
This antonym resource can be used to find antonyms or for antithesis detection in the German language.
The keys are the actual word, the values are its antonyms.
There are two versions of the AntonymDict: one is case sensitive (AntonymDictCaseSensitiv.txt, based on dump from 01.03.2023), and one is completely lowercase (AntonymDict.txt), which was used in the paper mentioned above.

To load the Dictionary and to work with, you can use following code:
```
import ast

# load antonym dictionary
with open("AntonymDict.txt", mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    antonym_file = f.read()
antonym_dict = ast.literal_eval(antonym_file)

```

## Wiktionary Parser
It is based on regular expressions to extract the antonyms ("Gegenw√∂rter"). It only selects antonyms in the German language. It can be extended to also extract synonyms, idiomatic expressions, etc.
